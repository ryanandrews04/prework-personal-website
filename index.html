    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div id="body">
            <p>My name is Ryan and I am starting the software development course at Flatiron School in April. This is my first customized website and I am excited to get started!</p>
            <p>Since I'm not entirely sure what to put on my first website yet, I'll just add some things I've been into recently.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning guitar</li>
                <li>Improving cooking</li>
                <li>Exploring NYC more</li>
                <li>Getting into a new career field (obviously)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With guitar, I've been able to learn a lot of songs much more quickly than expected thanks to my favorite youtube channel, "GuitarZeroToHero." Here is a link to one of the first songs I learned from him; <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3LzCJlSEfQ&t=756s"><em>GuitarZero2Hero - Shallow from A Star is Born Guitar Tutorial</em></a></p>

            <p>With cooking, I found it to be one of the most satisfying and rewarding things to be able to slave in the kitchen and have the outcome be even better than you expected. That feeling is exponential when you're cooking for someone else and it's a feeling I can't get enough of. With that, I've been into cooking shows on YouTube and Netflix. Some of my favorite "celebrity chefs" include Binging with Babish, Sam the Cooking Guy, and, of course, Gordon Ramsay.</p>

            <p>With NYC and a new career path, I'm still relatively new here and am excited to continue this journey that I'm on. Originally from Syracuse, NY, I've always wanted to move to the big city and have a job I really enjoy. I think programming will be a great fit for me.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I think that's enough about me for now. I can't wait to look back here and see how much I've improved. Thanks for checking this out! </p>
